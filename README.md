Friday Shots Enhancement Proposals (FSEPs)
------------------------------------------

### FSEP 1. (cpollock)
Ideally we would have about one winner per month so there's been
discussion of making the shot harder. The most obvious way to shoot from
further away.  It's probably best to wait and see roughly how many
winners per week we get.

### FSEP 2. (dselassi) -- ACCEPTED 2014-02-07
Currently the rules stipulate that a single-shot nerf gun must be
used. It has been proposed that we allow darts to be thrown. It is
unlikely throwing the dart will give the thrower an advantage -- if
anything it seems like a disadvantage.

### FSEP 3. (cpollock) -- ACCEPTED 2014-02-14
Start the game at 5:00pm
