Friday Shots
=============

Rules
-----
1. The competition begins every Friday at 5:30pm.
2. Anyone in the office at the time of the competition can participate.
3. Each participant gets to take one shot after paying the $1 entry fee. All 
   fees must be paid prior to the first shot.
4. All shooters who hit the bell will split the pot.
5. Only one game may be played per week.
6. run.py must be used to run the game. Someone must update the stats in the
   README once the game is done.


Meta Rules
----------
1. The co-Benevolent Dictators for Life are cpollock and dselassi. They must
   agree to any rule changes.
2. All proposed changes must be written up as FSEPs.

Bell Strikage Success Criteria
------------------------------
1. The shooter must have both of his or her feet on the ground and be behind
   the line where the color of tile changes.
2. The shooter must use a single-shot nerf gun. No shooter may claim a gun or
   dart-- all equipment (including personal equipment) must be available to all
   shooters.
3. The dart must strike the bell directly without first contacting anything
   else.


Friday Shots Enhancement Proposals (FSEPs)
------------------------------------------
FSEP 1. Ideally we would have about one winner per month so there's been
   discussion of making the shot harder. The most obvious way to shoot from
   further away. It's probably best to wait and see roughly how many winners
   per week we get.

FSEP 2. Currently the rules stipulate that a single-shot nerf gun must be used.
   It has been proposed that we allow darts to be thrown. It is unlikely
   throwing the dart will give the thrower an advantage-- if anything it seems
   like a disadvantage.
